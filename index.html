		<p>Welcome to my Ultimate Gary Sinise Fan Page! My name is Marge and I'll be your guide to all things Gary! My friends always tell me I'm probably Gary's biggest fan since I know so much about his music career, so I decided to make this web page to prove it!</p>

		<p>I've been a fan of Gary and his bass skills for as long as I can remember. I'll never forget the first time I laid eyes on him in 2004, when he rocked my world at the House of Blues with his swingin' bass riffs. It was so magical. Since then I've gone to as many of his shows as I could. He's such a great guy that most of his gigs go completely to charity! His parents should have named him Gary So-Nice!

		<p>Now, it's no secret that Gary currently heads up the Lt. Dan Band and is just about the best darn bass-fiddlin' thumpmaster out there, but did you know he got his start providing the low-end for Steppenwolf? "Born to Be Wild" indeed! That's just one of the cool facts I have waiting for you in the GAryQs section. And if you just feel like checkin' out some hot pics of your favorite bassman, that OK too! Just head on over to the "See"nise Gary section to view my curated collection of Gary's sexiest bass moments. And if you're feelin the groove, please feel free to drop me a line at margegary42@gmail.com or in the comment area at the bottom of the page.</p>

		<p>I hope you love my Gary page as much as I do. Thanks for stopping by,</p>
